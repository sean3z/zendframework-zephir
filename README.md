## Zend Framework (via Zephir)

> Zephir - (ZE)nd Engine (PH)p (I)nt(R)mediate - is a high level language that eases the creation and maintainability of extensions for PHP. Zephir extensions are exported to C code that can be compiled and optimized by major C compilers such as gcc/clang/vc++. Functionality is then exposed to the PHP language.

#### Getting Started
To get started, you will need to install [Zephir](http://zephir-lang.com).
